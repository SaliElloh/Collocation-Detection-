<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About the Project:

### Introduction:

This project implements methods for identifying collocations in text using two association measures: Chi-Square and Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI). The main objective is to detect and rank bigram collocations based on these measures, which can be useful in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as identifying word pairs that occur together more frequently than expected.

### Project Overview:

Collocations are combinations of words that frequently appear together in text and have a special meaning when used together. For this project, we will be calculating and comparing collocations using Chi-Square and PMI measures to identify significant bigrams in a given corpus.


### Chi-Square and PMI Measures:
* **Chi-Square**: A statistical measure used to evaluate the independence of two events (in this case, word pairs). A higher chi-square value indicates a stronger association between the words.
* **PMI**: Measures the association between two words by comparing their co-occurrence probability with the product of their individual probabilities. A higher PMI score indicates that the words occur together more often than expected.
